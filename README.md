Very nice work, Christian Helgeson! üôå

# Description

This is using Three.js and the new WebGPU API to render a murmuration of birds in the background of the login screen.

Because WebGPU is still in development, this plugin is experimental and may not work well in all browsers.

This should improve soon.

The original work is under a MIT license I believe and this plugin will be free to use.

I have changed the original code to make the birds begin in a more pleasing way.
